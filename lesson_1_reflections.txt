How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It help me fix the bug in less time.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because you can undo updates if something went wrong or compare the best way of doing things.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros is that you can managed the commits and use the diff functions the cons is that there is no way to measure a good commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because git was created for software proyects and one or many files can be related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    The command git log shows all the commits that have been done and git diff needs 2 ID's that the git log provides.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can have different versions that you can undo if somethign went wrong.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To expand my knowledge in Tecnology and because companies demand that program.
