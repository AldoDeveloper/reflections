When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When a proyect is big enough to have more than 1 collaborator

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you might been working with some files that haven't been commited, and changes will get lost

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks is the same as clone but copy's the main author for it's credits, clone copys a full repository without giving credits to the real author,
    and branches makes a copy of the working directory for future versions. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    That you can work with the new remote features and integrate your local work to that features without having internet.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I think that both of this tecnologies go along, but if I had to choose one, I rather choose github to collaborate with multiple people.
